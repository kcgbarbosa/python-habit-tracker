2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program with:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How Itâ€™s Made

**Tech used:** Python, JSON

The application is structured around modular functions for each operation, ensuring maintainable and readable code. Habit data is persisted in a JSON file, and the program includes:

* Input validation for menu selections and habit operations.
* Error handling for missing or corrupted JSON data.
* Clear terminal prompts guiding the user through CRUD operations.
* Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for habit management.

The project demonstrates solid Python fundamentals and practical experience in building a functional, structured application.
